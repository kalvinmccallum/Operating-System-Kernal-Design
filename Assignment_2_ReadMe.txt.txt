EECE 4811 - Operating System and Kernel Design
Assignment 2 - Readme.txt

Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment is to become familiarized with multithreading in a Linux operating system. 
This is made possible by creating two unique programs that utilize threads to implement a buyer and seller design. 
Using fundamental Linux functions, the threads are created and execute the required tasks as defined in the lab 2 requirements. 

Source File Names:
1. Project2_Part1.c
2. Project2_Part2.c

Executable File Name & Run/Make Process:
Make Process Steps:
1. Open a linux terminal. 
2. Create a new directory. This can be done using the Mkdir command line followed by the desired nomenclature of your new directory.
   Note: This will write a new directory to the operating system on your machine. If you would prefer to have the new directory placed on your desktop then navigate to your desktop directory before 
   creating the new directory. This can be done by typing "cd Desktop" into the terminal before executing this step.
3. Once the new directory has been made, add the appropriate files to the new directory (Project2_Part1.c, Project2_Part2.c & Makefile). These files have been provided in the Assignment_1_Source_Code folder.
   This can be done by natigating to the directory on your machine and copying and pasting the files into the directory.
4. Enter the "make" command into the terminal to build the software programs and create the executable files in the new directory.
5. Once the make file has successfully compiled, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.

Project2_Part1.c:
Executable File Name: Project2_Part1
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./Project2_Part1". This will initiate the program Project2_Part1.c.
2. When prompted, enter the desired number of buyer threads (260) and press enter.
3. Once the program ends, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.


Project2_Part2.c:
Executable File Names: Project2_Part2.c
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./Project2_Part2". This will initiate the program Project2_Part1.c.
2. When prompted, enter the desired number of buyer threads (6) and press enter.
3. Once the program ends, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.
