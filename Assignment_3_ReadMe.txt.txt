EECE 4811 - Operating System and Kernel Design
Assignment 3 - Readme.txt

Purpose:
 

Source File Names:
1. Project3_Part1A.c
2. Project3_Part1B.c
3. Project3_Part1C.c
4. Project3_Part2.c

Executable File Name & Run/Make Process:
Make Process Steps:
1. Open a linux terminal. 
2. Create a new directory. This can be done using the Mkdir command line followed by the desired nomenclature of your new directory.
   Note: This will write a new directory to the operating system on your machine. If you would prefer to have the new directory placed on your desktop then navigate to your desktop directory before 
   creating the new directory. This can be done by typing "cd Desktop" into the terminal before executing this step.
3. Once the new directory has been made, add the appropriate files to the new directory (Project3_Part1.c, Project3_Part2.c & Makefile). 
   This can be done by natigating to the directory on your machine and copying and pasting the files into the directory.
4. Enter the "make" command into the terminal to build the software programs and create the executable files in the new directory.
5. Once the make file has successfully compiled, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.


Project3_Part1A.c:(Best Fit)
Executable File Name: Project3_Part1A
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./Project3_Part1A". This will initiate the program Project3_Part1A.c.
2. When prompted, enter the number of desired users and press enter. Note: Maximum users = 6.
3. Once the program ends, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.

Project3_Part1B.c:(First Fit)
Executable File Name: Project3_Part1B
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./Project3_Part1B". This will initiate the program Project3_Part1B.c.
2. When prompted, enter the number of desired users and press enter. Note: Maximum users = 6.
3. Once the program ends, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.

Project3_Part1C.c:(Worst Fit)
Executable File Name: Project3_Part1C
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./Project3_Part1C". This will initiate the program Project3_Part1C.c.
2. When prompted, enter the number of desired users and press enter. Note: Maximum users = 6.
3. Once the program ends, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.

Project3_Part2.c:(Fragmentation)
Executable File Names: Project3_Part2.c
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./Project3_Part2". This will initiate the program Project3_Part1.c.
2. When prompted, enter the number of desired users and press enter. Note: Maximum users = 6.
3. Once the program ends, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.
