EECE 4811 - Operating System and Kernel Design
Assignment 1 - Readme.txt

Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment is to become familiarized with processes on the Linux operating system. 
This will be made possible by creating several functionally unique programs using the C programming language. 
Additionally, several Linux based commands/functions will be utilized to facilitate the desire program functionalities. 

Source File Names:
1. progA1.c
2. progA2.c
3. progB.c
4. progC.c

Executable File Name & Run/Make Process:
Make Process Steps:
1. Open a linux terminal. 
2. Create a new directory. This can be done using the Mkdir command line followed by the desired nomenclature of your new directory.
   Note: This will write a new directory to the operating system on your machine. If you would prefer to have the new directory placed on your desktop then navigate to your desktop directory before 
   creating the new directory. This can be done by typing "cd Desktop" into the terminal before executing this step.
3. Once the new directory has been made, add the appropriate files to the new directory (progA1.c, progA2.c, progB.c, progC.c, & Makefile). These files have been provided in the Assignment_1_Source_Code folder.
   This can be done by natigating to the directory on your machine and copying and pasting the files into the directory.
4. Enter the "make" command into the terminal to build the software programs and create the executable files in the new directory.
5. Once the make file has successfully compiled, enter the "clear" command in the terminal.

Part-1-A:
Executable File Name: ProgA1
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./progA1". This will initiate the program progA1.
2. Press "CTRL C" to terminate the program when ready.
3. Enter the "clear" command in the terminal.


Part-1-B:
Executable File Names: ProgA2
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./progA2". This will initiate the program progA2.
2. Press "CTRL C" to terminate the program when ready.
3. Enter the "clear" command in the terminal.
  
Part 2:
Executable File Name: ProgC
Run Process Steps:
1. In the other terminal enter "./progC". This will initiate the program progA.
2. When prompted, enter the integer "4" and press enter to continue running the program.
3. Close the terminal when ready.
